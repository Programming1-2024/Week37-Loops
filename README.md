# Week37-Loops

Hello again! This week's exercises will be about using loops and arrays. I made tests, but unfortunately my Visual Studio refused to run the tests for this solution specifically. So if the tests don't run, then it is likely a problem with the solution. If any of you figure out why it wouldn't run, then please share how to fix it!

Just like last time, you are done when the tests show green. If the tests don't run, then you can do manual testing by writing code in main()
